To use this plugin, you would:
Add it to your main application's dependencies:

{
  "dependencies": {
    "@ai16z/plugin-memecoin": "workspace:*"
  }
}

*********

Register the plugin in your application:
import { memeCoinPlugin } from "@ai16z/plugin-memecoin";

// Register plugin
runtime.registerPlugin(memeCoinPlugin);

// Now you can use it in conversations:
// "Create a new meme token called Doge Coin 2.0 with symbol DOGE2"
// "Buy 1000 DOGE2 tokens"
// "Sell 500 DOGE2 tokens"


****************

o complete this plugin, you would need to:
Implement the actual token creation logic using @solana/spl-token
Add proper error handling and validation
Implement the buy and sell token actions
Add proper token metadata handling
Add proper transaction confirmation handling
Add proper fee handling
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or show you the implementation of the buy/sell actions?
